# estima-server (Jimmy's fork)

Original project: https://github.com/neojski/estima-server

- `npm install`
- insert answers into js/index.js
- assign each team name a number starting from 0
- insert them into js/index.js
- `npm start`
- see `http://localhost:3000` for scoreboard and editor

## How to set-up
- have some router with you (android with tethering would do)
- have one main machine for running the server and displaying the scoreboard on the projector
- connect other laptops to the same network and navigate to http://main-machine's-ip:3000 for adding results
- don't let students use the same network. It is rendered client-side and one can see the database
